## Description

Web Application that allows you to manage your data in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) but it focuses on the first three phases which are:-
1. Initiation Phase
2. Requirement Phase (SRS)
3. Design Phase (SDD)

## Installation

1. Make sure that you have installed Node.js in your device using command `node -v` to see what Version is currently running.
   - If it's not installed. Go to [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) then download and install the latest stable version.

2. Run `ng --version` in cmd to see which Version of Angular is currently installed.
   - If it's not installed, run `npm install -g @angular/cli@13.3.3`.
   - If the version is old then you can update the version using command `ng update @angular/cli @angular/core`.

3. Open cmd and navigate to folder location using cd command or just open cmd in the required location then run command `npm install` to download node_modules and all dependencies. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests
